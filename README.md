# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware with full laser functionlatity

Laser functionality builds on https://github.com/TurnkeyTyranny/buildlog-lasercutter-marlin

Laser modes
- Continuous
- Pulsed
- Raster

M649 command to set options

Control laser
G1 S30  => On with G1, off with G0, intensity 30
M3/M5  => On/Off
G7  => Cut raster of encoded raster b/w
M649 S0 => Laser off. Use Sx to set intesity for G1 movements
           or override at every G1 like G1 X.. Y.. S10
Laser intensity is in the range 0-100.

Laser intensity vs speed
The energy a certain point on the workpiece receives depends on
the laser intensity and the travel velocity. When accelerating
the laser head this will lead to uneven energy => uneven laser marks
and engravings unless handled.
In continuous laser mode, this is not handled. This leads to more energy
at the areas where the laser head accelerates. Using continuous mode
for engraving a picture will lead to darker regions at the edges of the
engraving.
In pulsed and raster mode this is handled in a way that the surface
receives an even energy per area regardless of any difference in speed
compared to the F setting. Engraved pictures will have a uniform grayscale
level even at the edges. This is what one would expect really.

The "laser pin" is D5 on the 2560. At this point this is hardcoded,
make sure to use that pin.

Two timers are used, Timer 3 for laser intensity pwm,
Timer 4 for pulse length control.
These timers can not be used for any other purpose.

## Release Candidate -- Marlin 1.1.0-RC3 - 01 December 2015

__Not for production use â€“ use with caution!__

Previously tagged versions of Marlin are not recommended. However, the latest patches to the Marlin 1.0 series can be found in the [1.0.x](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/1.0.x) branch.

[This branch, "RC"](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RC), is our current pre-release candidate.

Future development takes place in the [MarlinDev repository](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/).

## Recent Changes
RC3 - 01 Dec 2015
      A number of language sensitive strings have been revised
      Formatting of the LCD display has been improved to handle negative coordinates better
      Various compiler-related issues have been corrected

RC2 - 29 Sep 2015
      File styling reverted
      LCD update frequency reduced

RC1 - 19 Sep 2015
      Published for testing

## Submitting Patches
Proposed patches should be submitted as a Pull Request against the [RCBugFix](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RCBugFix) branch
Note: Do not propose added features. Patches to the Release Candidate are limited to corrections of coding errors for the functions that have been implemented.
Please follow the proper style. Pull requests containing styling errors will have to be reworked.



## Current Status: Testing

Please test this firmware and inform us of any issues where it fails to perform in a manner consistent with the designed functionality.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
